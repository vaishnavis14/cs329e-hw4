This project analyzes and visualizes star positions using the Bright Star Catalog dataset (bsc5.csv). It converts right ascension and declination into degrees, maps these to equatorial and galactic coordinate systems using Astropy, and assigns star colors based on spectral types. The project employs Plotly and Matplotlib to create interactive and static scatter plots, offering insights into the spatial distribution of stars across both coordinate systems.
